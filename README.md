# EKEMA — Offline-first Intelligent Assistant (Cameroon)

EKEMA is a production-ready Flutter Android application designed to help Cameroonian citizens navigate administrative and academic procedures. It operates **100% offline**, using a local JSON knowledge base and featuring a voice-first interaction system in French and Camfranglais.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Offline-first AI Dialogue**: A JSON-driven decision tree engine that guides users through complex procedures via a conversational interface.
- **Real Procedures**: Accurate data for CNI (IDCAM), Passports (PASSCAM), ENS Concours, and more (sourced from idcam.cm, passcam.cm, uninet.cm).
- **Official Document Generator**: Automatically generates PDF documents (A4 format) like scholarship requests or letters to the Dean, ready to sign and print.
- **Offline Maps**: Integrated OpenStreetMap for locating administrative offices in Yaoundé and other cities.
- **Voice Interaction**: Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech support for enhanced accessibility.
- **Premium Design System**: strictly follows the `ekema.html` design tokens (Poppins/Fraunces typography, custom green palette).
- **History & Favorites**: Uses Sqflite for local storage of past searches and generated documents.
